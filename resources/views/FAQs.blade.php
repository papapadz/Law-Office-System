                            Offline consultation usually involves a customer having to visit a particular law firm for their consultation. But, in our case we found a way to make it a less hassle experience for the customer. The customer can select a schedule for their offline consultation meaning that they can set a schedule for their visit even without physically going to the law firm. The only travel that they will do is when it is time for their offline consultation schedule. It is a convenient and hassle free way for customers because it gives them assurance that there will be a lawyer who will tend to their needs and they don't have to wait for a lawyer to consult with them.
